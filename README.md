# <a name="features"></a>What it does
* A teacher can register and create courses which the students can join.
* A teacher can also add a student individually by using his/her registration number.
* Inside the course, the teacher can also create exams (objective, subjective or both).
* A proctor can be assigned to an exam and the exam will start only once the proctor joins.
* A notification is sent to the proctor and students 15 minutes prior to the exam as a reminder.
* The proctor will be able to get the live webcam feed of any student on demand. The proctor can also send warnings in case of any suspicious activities.
* A discussion forum has been implemented in a course where students can clarify queries. Both text and images are allowed.
* We're storing responses of students in a file system, and the proctor can use these responses to correct the exams.
* Once correction is done, students will be able to see their result. A piechart is also there to show their result.

# <a name="made"></a>What we used to implement it:
* Frontend: JavaFX
* Backend: Java
* Database: MYSQL

# <a name="challenges"></a>Challenges we ran into
* It was the first time we used UDP, and we tried to run it over LAN. After a few tries and a little reading, we successfully did it.
* Creating a robust infrastructure for dynamically adding components in FXML.

# <a name="future"></a>What's next for Fair And Simple
* Randomly change videos of students and send signals when suspicious activities are detected.
* For detecting suspicious activities, use face detection and detect if there are multiple faces or a face isn't being detected.
